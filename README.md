*What is the background of your company? What do they do? Who are their competitors?*
​      Robinhood
      It's an American financial services company based in Menlo Park, California.  They are an internet stock trading platform with unlimited no-commission trading for stocks, ETFs, crypto, etc.
      Their competitors: DOXEE.io, Webull, CoinBase, Acorns.
      
*How does this company use technology to their advantage? Why are they considered a FinTech company?*
​      All of the customer interaction is through their app and website. They use 29 different technology packages includeing HTML5, Google Analytics, etc. Robinhood consolidates thousands of trades to reduce          the overall costs of the transactions. Robinhood has made it much easier and simple for smaller retail investors to own and trades stocks without large account balances or trading fees.

    * Why is this company exemplary in the FinTech space? What are their strengths and weaknesses?
​      They have a very large userbase (10.8 million active users in 2022) and make their revenue off of transactions and net interest.  Their user base has been very aggressive in trading and shorting stocks.         Competitors are trading firms like JP Morgan, Charles Schwab, TD Ameritrade. 
      Weaknesses include limited research and training content for traders. Robinhood is limited to use by hands-on passive investors. Another weakness is limited customer support.

    * What is the prognosis for this company? Where do they expect to be in the future?
      It had a great deal of userbase growth through 2022, but usercount has been declining recently. The SEC is currently looking at eliminating paying for "order flow", which is a major source of income for Robinhood. Essentially, large Wall Street          firms are paying to handle Robinhood transactions inside of dark pools.

## Hint
​
If you and your partner plan to work on the file at the same time, be aware of merge conflicts. That is, be careful not to create separate versions of the file, as git will not know which version should take precedence. Learn more about git merge conflicts [here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/resolving-a-merge-conflict-using-the-command-line).
